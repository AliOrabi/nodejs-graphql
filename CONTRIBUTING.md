Adding more countries to the project helps other to discover it's contribution to the GitHub.

#### Add new country
##### Server
##### Create new country array object [country.js](https://github.com/gayanvoice/githubstats-github-graphql/country.js).
The array structure is ` {city: ["Country_Name", "CountryName", "City", "City"]}` You can add five most populated cities. These cities should be supported by GitHub (Sometimes the native languages may not work).

#### After you have done the changes you can create a [Create request](https://github.com/gayanvoice/githubstats/pulls) and name it `Add Country Name` for an example `Add Austria`. After the review, if there are no errors your contribution will be displayed in [GitHubStats](http://www.githubstats.com/) with a link to your GitHub profile.
